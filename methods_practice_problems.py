# 1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word with all capital letters.

# word = input("Enter any word here: ")

# print(word.upper())

# 2. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a big number" if the number is greater than 100.

# number = input("Print number here: ")

# if int(number) > 100:
#     print("That's a big number")
# else:
#     print("That's not a big number")

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.

# n1 = input()
# n2 = input()

# print(int(n1) + int(n2))

# 4. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word in reverse order.

# word = input()[::-1]

# print(word)

# 5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints the number times 10.

# number = input("Enter a number here: ")
# print(int(number) * 10)

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.

# w1 = input()
# w2 = input()
# print(f"{w1.upper()} {w2.upper()}")

# 7. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints the number of letters in the word.

# word = input()
# print(len(word))

# 8. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a negative number" if the number is less than 0.

# number = input()

# if int(number) < 0:
#     print("That's a negative number")
# else:
#     print("That's not a negative number")

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the two numbers multiplied together.

# n1 = input()
# n2 = input()
# print(int(n1) * int(n2))

# 10. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints "That's a long word" if the word has more than 5 letters.

# word = input()

# if len(word) > 5:
#     print("That's a long word")
# else:
#     print("That's not a long word")
