# 1. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string concatenation (the + operator).

# first_name = input("First Name: ")
# last_name = input("Last Name: ")

# print(first_name + " " + last_name)

# 2. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# first = input("First Name: ")
# second = input("Last Name: ")

# print(f"{first} {second}")

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to input a word. If the word is "marco", print "polo".

# word = input()

# if word.lower() == "marco":
#   print("Polo")
# else:
#   print("Sorry, try again")

# 4. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string concatenation (the + operator).

# c1 = "red"
# c2 = "white"
# c3 = "blue"

# print(c1 + " " + c2 + " " + c3)

# 5. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# print(f"{c1} {c2} {c3}")

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter a name. If the name is not "Santa", print "You're not Santa."

# name = input("Print name here: ")

# if name.lower() == "santa":
#   print("Hi Santa")
# else:
#   print("You're not Santa")

# 7. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).

# book = "12 Rules for Life"
# author = "Jordan Peterson"
# sentence = "A great book to read is " + book + " " + "by " + author + "."
# print(sentence)

# 8. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# sentence = f"A great book to read is {book} by {author}."
# print(sentence)

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. If the password is "Joshua", the program responds "Shall we play a game?". For any other password, the program responds "Access denied"

# password = input("Please input password here: ")

# if password == "Joshua":
#     print("Shall we play a game?")
# else:
#     print("Access denied")

# 10. Write a program that uses variables to store the names of three cities, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).

# c1 = "Meadville"
# c2 = "Henderson"
# c3 = "Seattle"

# print("Here's 3 interesting cities: " + c1 + ", " + c2 + ", and " + c3 + ".")
# print(f"Here's 3 interesting cities: {c1}, {c2}, and {c3}.")
