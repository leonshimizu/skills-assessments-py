# 1. Write a while loop to print the numbers 1 through 10.

# i = 1
# while i <= 10:
#     print(i)
#     i += 1

# for x in range(1, 11):
#     print(x)

# 2. Write a while loop that prints the word "hello" 5 times.

# i = 0
# while i < 5:
#     print("hello")
#     i += 1

# for x in range(5):
#     print("hello")

# 3. Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a word and will run forever until the user enters the word "stop".

# word = input()
# while word != "stop":
#     print("Go")
#     word = input()

# 4. Write a while loop that prints the numbers 0 through 100, increasing by 5 each time.

# i = 0
# while i <= 100:
#     print(i)
#     i += 5

# for x in range(0, 105, 5):
#     print(x)

# 5. Write a while loop that prints the number 9000 ten times.

# for x in range(10):
#     print(9000)

# 6. Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a number and will run forever until the user enters a number greater than 10.

# number = "0"

# while int(number) < 11: # works with or without the else statement
#     number = input()
#     if int(number) > 10:
#         print("Perfect")
#         break
#     # else:
#     #     print("Not high enough")

# 7. Write a while loop that prints the numbers 50 to 70.

# i = 50
# while i <= 70:
#     print(i)
#     i += 1

# for i in range(50, 71):
#     print(i)

# 8. Write a while loop that prints the phrase "Around the world" 144 times.

# for i in range(144):
#     print("Around the world")
#     print(i)

# 9. Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a word and will run forever until the user enters a word with more than 5 letters.

# word = ""

# while len(word) < 6:
#     word = input()
#     if len(word) > 5:
#         break

# 10. Write a while loop that prints the even numbers from 2 to 40.

# for i in range(2, 41, 2):
#     print(i)
